# The Law Above the Law
### God's Enduring Principles for a Just Society

---

### *Soli Deo Gloria*
To God alone be the glory. This project is undertaken with the conviction that all truth, goodness, and justice find their source and their end in Him. Any wisdom found in these pages is merely a reflection of His light; all errors are my own.

### Project Mission

This project is a collection of writings dedicated to exploring the enduring authority of God's law and its application to modern life. It is intended to equip serious Christians with a robust, theologically-grounded framework for navigating a secular, pluralistic world with faithfulness, courage, and grace.

Rejecting both a retreat from public life and the simple imposition of a legalistic code, this work argues for a path of **principled persuasion**. It seeks to translate the timeless "general equity" of biblical justice into the language of the common good, thereby serving as salt and light in the public square.

### Guiding Principles

The analysis in these writings is built upon several foundational convictions of the historic Reformed tradition:

*   **The Sovereignty of God:** All authority in heaven and on earth belongs to God. All human authority—whether in the family, the church, or the state—is delegated, limited, and accountable to Him.
*   **The Authority of Scripture:** The Holy Bible is the inspired, infallible, and sufficient Word of God. It is the ultimate source and standard for all of life, including our understanding of justice, liberty, and the role of government.
*   **The Doctrine of Common Grace:** While saving grace is for believers alone, God's common grace sustains the created world, restrains evil, and allows for truth, beauty, and civic justice to exist in a fallen world. This creates the basis for a pluralistic society and the possibility of finding common ground on matters of public justice.
*   **The Call to Principled Persuasion:** The Christian's primary civic duty is not to rule by command, but to bear witness and to persuade. We are called to love our neighbors by seeking a just and stable society for all, making our arguments in the public square with wisdom, clarity, and respect.

    *   **Foundations:** These pieces emphasize the groundwork of the arguments being presented.

*   **For In-Depth Analysis & Reflection:**
    *   **Discourses:** Comprehensive, reasoned explorations of complex theological or social topics.
    *   **Meditations:** More contemplative, theological reflections on the nature of justice and law.
    *   **Inquiries:** Focused investigations into a specific question or contemporary challenge.
    *   **Commentaries:** Detailed analysis of Scripture or legal precedent as it relates to public life.

*   **For Public Persuasion & Application:**
    *   **Briefs:** Concise, logical arguments addressing specific cultural or political issues.
    *   **Appeals:** Passionate, persuasive calls to action or understanding for a broad audience.
